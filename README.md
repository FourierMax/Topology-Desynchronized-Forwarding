This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"Topology-desynchronized Forwarding via Symmetry in Toroidal Networks"** published in *Nature Communications*. The code provides simulation frameworks for evaluating reverse-flow forwarding mechanisms in torus topologies.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This work introduces a novel forwarding mechanism that leverages the inherent symmetries of toroidal networks to achieve reliable packet forwarding without topological synchronization. The proposed approach reduces packet loss by up to 17.5% in 16Ã—16 torus networks with 1% link failure rate.

### Key Features
- **Symmetry-driven Forwarding**: Exploits rotational and reflection symmetries of 2D torus topologies
- **Reverse Flow Mechanisms**: Implements RF-CF (Counter-facing) and RF-LF (Lateral-facing) strategies
- **Protocol Independence**: Requires no modifications to packet headers or control plane
- **Comprehensive Simulation**: Supports both bond percolation (link failures) and site percolation (node failures)

This repository contains MATLAB implementations and experimental results for various forwarding algorithms:

- **NF (Normal Forwarding)**: Traditional shortest-path routing
- **RF (Random Forwarding)**: Topology-desynchronized approaches
  - RF-CF (Counter-facing)
  - RF-LF (Lateral-facing)
- **LFA (Loop-Free Alternates)**: Standard protection mechanism
